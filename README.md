<P> Welcome to Ionspace, a text editor that is designed for multi-language coding. The languages are endless; HTML, CSS, Ruby, JS, Java, PHP, C++, C#, React, Angular, MVC, and many more!. <b> However, </b> I designed this project so it would go along with the programming languages I learn. So this isn't going to become one thing in just one go. </p>

<p> <b> This text editor is also designed for beginners in mind. </b> </p>

<p> This text editor will also have tutorials and such for beginners, and will allow beginners to see how they can applie what they learned. </p>

<h1> This text editor was inspired by my journey right now. Done with HTML, halfway through CSS (on FreeCodeCamp), and when I started looking around to learn coding, I kept finding things that weren't that helpful in my opinion. So I decided to create this project on GitHub. </h1>

<p> If someone is reading this, welcome. This is my personal project, you <b> DO NOT </b> need to help. If you would like to, I would more than happily do so. However, I want to practice and get better at my programming skills, so if you want to join, you might have to teach me a few things here and there. Don't worry, I'm not impatient. HAHAHA. </p>
